            <p>
              BookBuzz is an application created for users to find new books to
              read, save for later, create book clubs and join clubs based on
              their reading interests. It is a fun interactive app for users to
              connect with others who share the same interest in books. The
              inspiration behind this app was to create a platform for book
              lovers to come together and connect.
